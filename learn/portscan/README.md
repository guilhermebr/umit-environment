    # Solved in portscan1_1.py to portscan1_6.py examples. 
	
2 - Accept portrange option (Ex: 21-80)

3 - If port is null, set a default portrange to scan (/etc/services is a good list =])

4 - Add options to scan types (TCP, UDP, IP)

5 - Add a option to get the hosts to scan in a file.

6 - Write scan results in DB (sqlite? mongodb?)
